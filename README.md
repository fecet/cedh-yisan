# Introduction
[Chinese primer](https://www.iyingdi.com/web/bbspost/detail/2359987)

Most content in [BRC](https://www.moxfield.com/decks/IOyWxvodxkiGECm8CIulEA) also suitable for this deck , in fact, I assume you have read it before this primer.

This deck aiming to winning the game by generating infinite mana at turn 4 or earlier, but also

# Notable inclusion:

[[Urza's Saga]]: sol ring or cradle(map)

[[Vitalize]]: Green Ritual enable many fast winnings.

Yeva: Can be simply replaced by [[Slippery Bogbonder]].

# Notable exclusion:

Ezone:  Most line still work without it.

[[Sakura-Tribe Scout]]: It's a bad dork and become useless in combo since we have recliamer.

[[Elvish Visionary]]: we already have [[war room]].


# Wincon

Once we have inf mana and duskwatch is avaliable, we can immediately "draw" all creatures, and the loop

- flash any creatures
- actiavte reclaimer to sacrifce it and put any land into play
- untap reclaimer and the land
- flash ewit return this body
- return ewit by temur

put any land into play.


we have two ways to get the noncreature and nonlands card we want:

- [[war room]] since we only have 33 such cards, just put all creaturs into hand and all land into play, then pay 33 life for them, Sooze help us recover, and we can have inf life once we get [[nature's claim]]. 

- use duskwatch to put any card on top of our deck:
  - find it and put it on the bottom, the order is determind by the quotient of your decks number and 3.
  - put all cards above it on the bottom
  - draw it by [[war room]] or [[Sanitarium]]


We cut ezone so we can only abuse creatures and lands. Note I mean  "all creaturs", the way to abuse colorless creature is:

- unset yisan
  - Scarfice yisan
  - recast it from commander zone
  - [[Destiny Spinner]] give it haste
- Bounce the colorless creature by techince mentioned below(by shaman)
- note we dont put the colorless creature into hand
- then verse it into field
- loop.

if it's not on the battfield at the beginning, we should unset yisan and verse it by obvious way.

The neccesry parts in the following loop, such as [[beast within]], [[Destiny Spinner]],[[
Temur Sabertooth]],[[Eternal Witness]], land untapper, are obviously accesable and ommited.

## Outlet

- [[Yavimaya Hollow]]+[[ram through]]
- [[Sanitarium]]+dosan

## Tips

[[Loaming shaman]] can do a lot of things if neccessary, note when we use shaman as a backup for one of them, the other one should be avaliable.

- backup of Ewit .
- backup of temur: kinda complicated:

Ashaya can become a 60/60, so you can still kill a player even in the case you can't reuse [[ram through]].


### Shaman(Bounce or Regrowth)

For simpify, we asasmue we already draw our entire deck by [[war room]] but leave an artifact creature and [[nature's claim]] in deck. We dont need to do so in practice since we can put specific card on top of our library.

- unset yisan
- Scarfice [[Eternal Witness]] and yisan, put thing you want to [[regrowth]] or [[Boomerang]] into graveyard(fight, beast within, reclaimer),
- cast [[loaming shaman]]
- now the decks are artifact creature, nature's claim, ewit, the thing, yisan
- activate duskwatch for [[Eternal Witness]] and yisan
- flash yisan, give it haste and verse for that artifact creature
- draw the other 2 cards by [[war room]]
- target natures'claim to the artifact creature
- cast [[Eternal Witness]] return [[loaming shaman]]
- net 2 life each time so you also get inf life.

note without temur, we cant put all lands into play, but we can still put all of them into graveyard. Then we can put them back by modifing above loops.

The Vitalize means any speel with similar effect.([[Vitalize]], [[Mobilize]], [[Benefactor's Draught]],[[Copperhorn Scout]]), if you see one in your open hand, then
